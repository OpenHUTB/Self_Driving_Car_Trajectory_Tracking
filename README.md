Following is the list of implemented controllers:
- Lateral Controllers:
  - Bang-Bang Controller
  - PID Controller
  - Pure-Pursuit Controller
  - Stanley Controller
  - Proximally Optimal Predictive (POP) Controller
- Longitudinal Controllers:
  - PID Controller
  - Adaptive Longitudinal Controller (ALC)
